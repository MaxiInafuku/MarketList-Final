# MarketList-Final
Small self taught proyect. My own market list app created in kotlin using Android Studio when Chat GPT wasn't a thing. 
The more important features, or at least the ones I was looking for in an app and couldn't find are:
1) It allows to create different "markets", for example: supermarket, hardware store, pharmacy, etc.
2) You can add products to each "market" which are never deleted.
3) Then, you can go to each "market" and add the products to the actual shopping list, you can add as many as you want and even have rational numbers as quantities.
4) Once in the shopping list meny, you can cross products bought and then'll be deleted from the shopping list (but not from the "market" section).
